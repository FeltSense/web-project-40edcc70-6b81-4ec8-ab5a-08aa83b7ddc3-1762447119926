      "component": "ProjectFilter",
      "challenge": "Multiple filter types (industry, service) working together",
      "mitigation": "Maintain filter state object, combine filter logic with AND/OR operators, clear visual feedback"

  "fixerContext": {
    "expectedStructure": "Simple Next.js app. Components in components/ folder at root. app/page.tsx imports from ../components/",
    "importPaths": "Use '../components/ComponentName' from app/page.tsx",
    "commonIssues": [
      "Missing 'use client' directive on interactive components (Navigation, ProjectFilter, ContactForm, FeaturedProjects)",
      "Import path mismatches - ensure all imports use '../components/' from app/page.tsx",
      "Image optimization - use Next.js Image component with proper width/height",
      "Key props missing in mapped arrays (portfolio items, team members, services)",
      "State management for filters and forms - ensure useState is imported and used correctly",
      "Responsive breakpoints - verify mobile, tablet, desktop layouts work properly",
      "Link components - use Next.js Link for internal navigation between pages",
      "CSS modules or Tailwind classes - ensure styling approach is consistent",
      "Accessibility - check for alt text on images, proper heading hierarchy, ARIA labels on interactive elements"
